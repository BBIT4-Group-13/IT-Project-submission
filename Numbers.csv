1,The timetable for the academic year's supplimentary and special exams is now out and pinned in the varsity notice boards. For those who can access the varsity find it on notice boards. I am making arrangements to have the pdf file uploaded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,I suggest that the school hospital should ask for a new ambulance since the one they got I really can't see if it has the capacity to help us. <3>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,The school dispensary has poor services like those equipment they are below the standard that should be having.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, Responsibility is key because if we were responsible students we could not be complaining about this issue at the school hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,If that is the case let's also be responsible students while visiting the school hospital to ask for help from the doctors available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,I suggest that there should be an increase in the number of dustbins in and around the pathways leading to the dispensary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"The dustbin at the school hospital should be maintained, that is it should be emptied almost twice a week or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Judging on your comments fellow learned Friends i see that you are concerned with the issues of cleaning at the dispensary which is a good idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,How can we be even talking about lack of water at the school dispensary really guys? It should be top priority since covid is spreading so fast. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Let us focus on the issues of lack of water at the school dispensary. This is a very hard pill to swallow because it's very essential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,comrades should be able to have a chance to help the school dispensary to deliver some of its functions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,As much as painkillers are necessary at the moment in the school hospital we should also push for the provision of good drugs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,That's a very good idea my friends. Let's look at the future of our younger friends who will have to look for services at the same school hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, listen people It is a good thing that we have to fight for our friends right at the school dispensary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,I am not sure but I think the school hospital does need the payment in order for them to treat their children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, Does the school dispensary help the students with babies or do the students have to pay in order to receive the service?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Guys we have no option but to tell our chairman to meet with the school hospital leader to address this issue at hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,So what do you suggest... What should we do about this dispensary issue please my learned friends? I need your honest input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,What are you saying..... can you listen to yourself if we send the chairman it shall not be done in time for the dispensary to have that meeting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,I propose we talk with the students chairman so that he should be able to meet the school hospital leaders and talk on our behalf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"So guys I’ll explain to you my stay in school. Attending lectures hasn’t been the main priority as it should be. Well provided I sit for the exams, what's the worry? Studies are for the chosen few.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Some lecturers should be serious and stop setting hard exams. Someone would think they never have had kids or they have never been students too. Well for this exams have seen dust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Notes so many you would think we are still back in high school. Are they even necessary? Why can’t someone invent a way of learning without using notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,Is it just me or we all don’t like the state of our library? What would happen if they worked on the state of that study facility? It really pissed me off that I couldn't use my desktop laptop to even get the notes from my machine with so much zeal of studying in the library. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
